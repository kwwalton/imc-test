# imc-test
Sample Vue app for IMC test

Lots of environmental issues.
- Had to use Node 14.11.0 instead of 10.15.3,
- Upgraded to Vue 3 and of course, there are enough differences between Vue 2 and 3, same with the router and vuex so had to learn quick.
- Balance between speed and quality, could do with refactoring, but for a test to demonstrate that I am capable, this should suffice.
- Tested on Windows 10 pc, Chrome, Firefox, Edge. 

To run this, do the 'npm install' and when that completes, 'npm run serve'
